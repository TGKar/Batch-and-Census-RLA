Code for "New Algorithms and Applications for Risk-Limiting Audits" simulations

All of the plots were generated using the functions from "main.py" (see their documentation).

The Plotter class is responsible for the actual plotting.

The election RLA is simulated using the ElectionAuditor class and the classes ending with "Assertion".

The census RLA is simulated using the CensusAuditor class.
