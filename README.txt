Code for "New Algorithms and Applications for Risk-Limiting Audits" simulations.

All of the plots were generated using the functions from "main.py" (see their documentation).

The Plotter class is responsible for the actual plotting.

The election RLA is simulated using the ElectionAuditor class and the classes ending with "Assertion".

The census RLA is simulated using the CensusAuditor class.

For additional plots regarding both Batchcomp and the census RLA method, see "New Algorithms and Applications for RLAs - Additional Plots.pdf". It includes
  - Comparisons between Batchcomp and ALPHA-Batch for two addtional election cycles.
  - Simulations for Batchcomp on the Israeli Knesset elections where the vote tallying is not entirely accurate.
  - Simulations for the census RLA where the census has enumeration errors.
